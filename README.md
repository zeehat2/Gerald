# Gerald

You said I could name my repo whatever I wanted. So I'm calling my program Gerald. I'll come up with a clever acronym for him when I have the time, But I made sure there was a G for "gender" and A for "age" in the name. ;)

On a more serious note, what I'm planning is a program that takes text as input, and tries to predict the age and gender of whoever wrote that text. You can read all about it in my deliverable 1!
